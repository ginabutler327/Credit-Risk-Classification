# Credit-Risk-Classification
Data Bootcamp Week 20 HW on Supervised Learning
In this homework, we were to use the logistic regression model of supervised learning to predict healthy and high-risk loans for a company.  
I used the Xpert Learning Chat and some of the in-class exercise, day 1 exercise 3 logistic regression - instructor solved.  

I only did the one model as I didn't think another model was necessary based on the accuracy, precision and recall scores.
